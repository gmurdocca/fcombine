Authentication System
=====================

Frontend:
---------
- Create a nav option called Authentication, in which new Authenticators can be
  created.
- Hard coded Authenticator exists called "Local", and allow addition of new ones
  via an Add button
- New Authenticators can be: RADUS or LDAP
- New RADUS Authenticator form:
    Radius Server:...
    Radius Auth Port:...
    Radius Secret:...
    Directory Service: [none, CSV, LDAP]
        None:   No directory service (no user details will be synced)
        Script: Specify location of a CSV (located on local FS or on a Server
                Link).
        LDAP:   Specify LDAP details
        * For CSV and LDAP options, specify duration wait between syncs
- New LDAP Authenticator form:
    LDAP Server details:...(host, port, search string, etc)
    Directory Service: [none, CSV, As Above]
        None:   No directory service (no user details will be synced)
        Script: Specify location of a CSV (located on local FS or on a Server
                Link).
        As Above: Use same LDAP server details as specified above
- The immutable "Local" authenticator can only be edited. In it, provide option
  to specify the directory service from which local user details can be synced,
  namely: [None, LDAP, CSV]
    None (Local Only): No directory service (no user details will be automatically synced,
          manual data entry only for local users)
    LDAP: Specify LDAP details
    CSV: Specify location of a CSV (located on local FS or on a Server
         Link).
- The behaviour of the directory service sync (duration, merge, overwrite, skip, remove orphans) will
  be made available as options where necessary.

Backend:
--------

- Split out DirectoryServer object and Authenticator oject. Link them as
  necessary in implementing the above.
- Create an LDAPServer object that can be linked to any authenticator or to an
  LDAPAuthenticator or LDAPDirectoryServer
